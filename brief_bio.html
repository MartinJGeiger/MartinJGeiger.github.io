<h2>Brief Bio</h2>

After being born November 1973 in <a href="http://www.ellwangen.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellwangen an der Jagst</a>, I grew up in <a href="http://www.aalen.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aalen</a>, Germany, where I also earned my "Abitur" (A-levels) at the <a href="https://sg-aalen.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schubart-Gymnasium</a>.
I am, since 1996, married to TLOML Monika Geiger, née Pilinszki.
<h3>Qualifications</h3>
My formal qualifications are based on my studies in "Wirtschaftswissenschaften" (Economics and Business Administration) at the <a href="http://www.uni-hohenheim.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universität Hohenheim</a> at Stuttgart, Germany, which I completed 1999 with a Diploma ranking 4th of all graduating students (=top 3%). I am also "Doktor der Wirtschaftswissenschaften ( <abbr title="Doktor">Dr.</abbr> oec.)" (summa cum laude) (Universität Hohenheim; submitted 2004, awarded 2005), and hold the academic degree of Master of Philosophy in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Nottingham</a>, UK. Also at the Universität Hohenheim, I successfully completed a postdoctoral <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Habilitation"</a>, earning the "Venia Legendi" in "Betriebswirtschaftslehre" (Business Administration; submitted 07/2008, awarded 2009).
<h3>Industry and academic positions held</h3>
Prior to joining the faculty of the Helmut-Schmidt-University/ University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg in July 2009, I held a position as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tenured</a> Associate Professor in Operations and Supply Chain Management at the <a href="http://www.sdu.dk/">University of Southern Denmark</a>, Odense campus, Denmark (2008–2009).
