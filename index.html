   I am scientist with an academic background in economics, business administration, and computer science.
      My current position is here: <a href="https://www.hsu-hh.de/logistik/team/geiger">HSU Hamburg</a>.

      <h3>Research interests</h3>
      My research interests revolve around difficult (often: NP-hard) optimization and decision making problems.
      More precisely, I investigate <i>planning problems</i>, or (more formally): my research is concerned with 
      the assignment of <i>values</i> to <i>variables</i>.
      Problems of interest can be categorized into two sub-classes:
      <ol>
         <li><b>Combinatorial optimization,</b> with applications in routing, scheduling, timetabling, etc. 
         Here, the objective is to find (optimal) values for a vector of decision variables <i>X</i>, such that some 
         function <i>f(X)</i> assumes a minimal value.<br />Employed methods stem from mathematical optimization, 
         graph theory, operations research, and related disciplines.</li>
         <li><b>(Multi-criteria) decision making under uncertainty,</b> with applications in dynamic capital allocation.
         There, the objective is to find values for a vector of decision variables <i>X</i>, such that some future
         outcome <i>F(X) = (f<sub>1</sub>(X), ..., f<sub>k</sub>(X))</i> is optimized.<br />Relevant methods require a
         thorough understanding of risk management and the underlying economics of the problem at hand.</li>
      </ol>
   </p>

      <h3>Research interests (informal)</h3>
      My dear wife Monika, who holds several degrees in higher education herself, looks at my work from a different perspective.
      According to her, an accurate description of my work is "looking at numbers on a screen". <br />
      And I agree: This is <i>exactly</i> what I am doing -- watching numbers go up, numbers go down. 
      However, I am really good at this.

   <p><h3>Programming competitions</h3></p>
   <p>
      I have participated in all <i>Vehicle Routing Challenges</i> of the <i>
         EURO Working Group
         on Vehicle Routing and Logistics Optimization VeRoLog</i>, 
      <u>winning</u> the competition <u>twice</u>, <u>once</u> ranking in <u>second</u>, and <u>once</u> in <u>third</u> place.

   <p>My most recent contribution was in JUN 2024 to PACE 2024.</p>
