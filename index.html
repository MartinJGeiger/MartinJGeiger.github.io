    <td>I am interested in hard (mostly: NP-hard) combinatorial optimization problems with applications in routing, scheduling, and timetabling. In this context, I am particularly focussing on (i) how to devise novel, best-in-class planning approaches and algorithms , (ii) structural properties of combinatorial search spaces, and (iii) the efficient implementation of modern heuristics in running systems (which includes the identification of efficiently solvable sub-problems and the construction of problem-specific, appropriate data structures).

<h2>General research interests</h2>
  <p>
</p>
  <p>
Some of my research activities are devoted to optimization/implementation challenges. I have participated in all VeRoLog Vehicle Routing Competitions (among many others), winning twice, once ranking in second, and once in third place.</p>
<p>My most recent contribution was in JUN 2024 to PACE 2024.</p>
